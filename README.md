# Why Pulse?

### **Pulse** is a light weight state management solution for your Flutter project. 

#### **🏹 Pulse's 3 Main Targets**

### 🚀   PRODUCTIVITY       |       ⚖️   SCALABILITY       |       🧩   MODULARITY


> **🎯** **PRODUCTIVITY**
> 
> **Pulse** is aimed to help you make your productivity high. It's intuitive and it won't take you long to build MVVM structure. You can write cleaner, more structural and more maintainable code.

> 🎯 **SCALABILITY**
> 
> **Pulse** is here to make your program's architecture highly scalable. You can easily make layer based architecture or feature based architecture. You can add new features or remove old features without worrying much about code duplication and complexity.

> 🎯**MODULARITY**
> 
> **Without Modules,** you can get headache and will probably end up in writing spaghetti code. Modules are easily attachable, detachable and switchable. But making modules isn't an easy task. But don't worry! **Pulse** will reduce your burden a lot. **Pulse** has built-in service locator.Therefore, you can inject your view models on your need so that your code can become less coupling and more cohesive. Pretty easy, right? 😉
